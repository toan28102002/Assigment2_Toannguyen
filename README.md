How to use my code: Just put the code clone the code into Visual Studio and it automatically runs for you with the data that I already gave.

I also do extra work by asking If you want to input your own employee data. 
If you want to enter your own employee details, respond with "Yes" when prompted.

How Employee Type is Determined:
  - If you input a value less than or equal to $50 per hour, the employee will be classified as a nonprofessional.
  - If you input a value greater than or equal to $5000 per month, the employee will be classified as a professional.

The Assignment does not give specific calculations so I did whatever I could. (assumptions )
